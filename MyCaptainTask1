# Question 1: Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and computes area.
from math import pi
r = float(input ("Input the radius of the circle : "))
print ("The area of the circle with radius " + str(r) + " is: " + str(pi * r**2))

Input the radius of the circle : 1.1
The area of the circle with radius 1.1 is: 3.8013271108436504

# Question 2: Write a python program to accept a filename from the user and print the extension of that.
filename = input("Input the Filename: ")
f_extns = filename.split(".")
print ("The extension of the file is : " + repr(f_extns[-1]))
Input the Filename: abc.py
The extension of the file is : 'py'
